# To-Do List React App

This repo was created for learning React basics using Hooks and other tools. It consumes [To-Do List Application Web API](https://github.com/ecenurarslan/todo-list-app-service) I developed with .Net Core to post / get data from.

This repo contains:
- Login / Register
- List Items

pages using the Web API above. New features and pages will be added soon.
